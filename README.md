Backend service depends on [midjourney-proxy](https://github.com/hugepizza/midjourney-proxy).

Or you can fork from the original project [midjourney-proxy](https://github.com/novicezk/midjourney-proxy) and add cors support.

Put your midjourney-proxy baseUrl and secret in setting page, then start using.
